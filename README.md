# Musica-v1.0

Everyone hates searching songs till they get a download link through google. What if there is a website where you can type your query and **only the download buttons are generated** and the download starts at that instant.

Well Musica-v1.0 is a MP-3 Downloader wesite which I designed for such a use.I just used Youtube Data API . Its a basic project Which I choosed to learn about Youtube Data API's.I hope Everyone Likes it :-).There are some issues left to be solved . And if you find any Bugs feel free to update the issues.

The Webpage doesn't look so good. And more Functionalities can be added.So Contributions are accepted.PR's are aceepted.
